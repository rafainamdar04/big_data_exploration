# Big Data Exploration with Pandas, Dask, Polars & PyArrow

This project focuses on working with large datasets using Python. I used the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset (`yellow_tripdata_2021-02.parquet`) to benchmark performance across **Pandas**, **Dask**, **Polars**, and **Numba**.

### ðŸš€ Key Highlights
- Compared **computation time** and **memory usage**
- Leveraged **PyArrow** for efficient Parquet file handling
- Used **iterative computing** for performance optimization

### ðŸ“Š Dataset  
NYC Yellow Taxi trip data for February 2021 in Parquet format.

### ðŸ“˜ Learning Source  
Based on the [LinkedIn Learning course by Miki Tebeka](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/).
